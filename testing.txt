mkdir - this is used for creating an empty directory
ls - listing 
      under this there are many option can be used 
               ls         # List files and directories
               ls -l      # Long listing format (detailed info)
               ls -a      # Show hidden files (files starting with `.`)
               ls -lh     # Human-readable format (sizes in KB, MB, etc.)
               ls -r      # Reverse order listing
               ls -t      # Sort by modification time
               ls -i      # Show inode numbers (file metadata ID)

The cat command is used to view and manipulate file contents.
       cat file.txt  # Display contents of a file
       cat file1 file2  # Concatenate multiple files
       cat *  # Display contents of all files in a directory
       cat -n file_name  # Show line numbers

The cp command copies files or directories from one location to another.
       cp devops.txt DevOps/  # Copy file to a directory
       cp -r Python DevOps/  # Copy an entire directory recursively   
       cp *.java destination_dir/
